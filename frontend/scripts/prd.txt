# Lotus Therapy Platform - Post-MVP PRD

# Overview  
Building upon the successful Lotus MVP (a functional 5-stage CBT chatbot prototype), this PRD outlines the next development phases to transform the prototype into a production-ready therapy platform. The platform will include user authentication, safety assessments, voice therapy sessions, personalized homework generation, and analytics dashboards.

The core value proposition remains: delivering accessible, structured cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions that adapt to user needs while maintaining clinical safety standards and providing actionable insights for personal growth.

# Core Features  

## 1. Infrastructure & Platform Foundation
**What it does**: Establishes production-ready authentication, database persistence, rate limiting, and payment processing.
**Why it's important**: Transforms localhost prototype into scalable, secure platform with proper user management and monetization.
**How it works**: Clerk authentication, Supabase database integration, Stripe subscription management, and API rate limiting.

## 2. Safety Assessment System  
**What it does**: Pre-session screening to identify users requiring crisis intervention and redirect them to appropriate resources.
**Why it's important**: Clinical safety requirement - prevents platform misuse for acute mental health crises.
**How it works**: 5-question assessment that blocks platform access if warning flags detected, with hotline redirection.

## 3. Enhanced Voice Session Management
**What it does**: Provides time-bound, state-driven voice therapy sessions with clear progression indicators.
**Why it's important**: Voice mode currently lacks session boundaries and user awareness of session duration/progress.
**How it works**: Defined session duration, visual progress tracking, automatic session termination logic.

## 4. Intelligent Reflection & Homework Generation
**What it does**: Analyzes session content to generate personalized homework, insights, and cognitive bias identification.
**Why it's important**: Extends therapeutic value beyond the session through actionable takeaways and continued learning.
**How it works**: Post-session AI analysis creates weekly practice tasks, conversation highlights, and personalized stories.

## 5. Analytics Dashboard & Progress Tracking
**What it does**: Provides user insights into their cognitive patterns, biases, and therapy progress over time.
**Why it's important**: Enables users to track growth and identify patterns in their mental health journey.
**How it works**: NLP analysis of session transcripts, streak tracking, bias detection, and progress visualization.

- Sets foundation for responsible therapy platform

## Enhanced Sessions Before Analysis (Phase 3)
- Session boundaries and state management improve user experience
- Proper session completion enables accurate homework generation
- Time tracking provides data for analytics

## Content Generation Before Visualization (Phases 4-5)
- Homework generation requires completed session data
- Analytics dashboard builds upon homework and session history
- Cognitive bias detection feeds into progress tracking

## Polish and Security Last (Phase 6)
- Final optimization after core functionality proven
- Security review once all features implemented
- Performance tuning based on complete feature set

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges
**Risk**: Clerk integration complexity with existing authentication
**Mitigation**: Start with basic Clerk setup, gradually migrate existing functionality

**Risk**: Database migration affecting existing localStorage functionality  
**Mitigation**: Implement hybrid approach, gradually migrate from localStorage to database

**Risk**: AI homework generation producing inappropriate or harmful content
**Mitigation**: Implement content filtering, human review process for generated content

## Clinical Safety Risks
**Risk**: Safety assessment missing users who need crisis intervention
**Mitigation**: Conservative assessment criteria, regular review of assessment questions with mental health professionals

**Risk**: Platform used inappropriately for severe mental health conditions
**Mitigation**: Clear messaging about platform limitations, regular user education

## Business and Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Feature scope creep extending development timeline
**Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition for each phase, defer nice-to-have features

**Risk**: Stripe integration complexity for subscription management
**Mitigation**: Start with single subscription tier, expand later

**Risk**: Rate limiting affecting user experience
**Mitigation**: Generous initial limits, monitoring and adjustment based on usage patterns
